## Known Issues

* This template is adapted from an early project for a software engineering class ([see here](https://github.com/jeremyrrose/museum-of-disposable-art/)). As such, the CSS is convoluted; the desktop view overuses Grid to force elements into place, and the mobile views are very hacky.
